World Event Description

How to trigger the event:
- To trigger my world event, click on any square that is within bounds of the World Model.

What should happen when the event is triggered:
- For my world event, a garden of flowers grows whenever a mouse clicks on a space within the World Model. Blue flowers
  will appear for all cardinal and diagonal neighbors of the clicked square that are within bounds. Since flowers attract bees,
  a bee will also spawn in the middle of all the flowers if the space is non-occupied. If one clicks on an occupied space, 
  the garden will grow, but a bee will not appear.

What the affected entities should do:
- The world event has no effect on miners, but changes the appearance and behavior of ore blobs. If an ore blob becomes a cardinal 
  neighbor of a flower background, it is transformed into a butterfly. Butterflies are new animated entities. They 
  seek graves (caused by bees killing entities). When reaching a grave, the butterfly will use its energy to change the grave into a 
  vein. The butterfly will then die and disappear completely.

What the new entity is and how it should behave:
- One of the new entities is a Bee that is spawned by triggering the world event on a non-occupied square. A Bee is animated and will
  seek the nearest entity that is either a minerNotFull, minerFull, blacksmith, oreBlob, or butterfly. If the bee catches up to one of those entities,
  the entity will die and the square will show a grave for the dead entity (which butterflies seek to turn into veins). The bee will also die 
  and disappear after stinging an entity. 
- The other new entity is a Butterfly (which is described in the bullet point above).
